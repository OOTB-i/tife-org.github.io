![Image description](/public/images/stef.jpg)
I’m currently working as managing partner at [Out of the box:](http://out-ofthebox.be) Center for research, child- and youth guidance and as an independent technology consultant on various projects. In the past, I’ve been a technical consultant at Centric.be, a security consultant, and various species of engineer.



You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/indig057), though I prefer end-to-end encrypted email for most purposes [contact info](http://tife.org/scripts/stef.txt).

Thanks for reading!
