I’m currently working as managing partner at [Out of the box:](http://out-ofthebox.be) Center for research, child- and youth guidance and as an independent technology consultant on various projects. In the past, I’ve been a technical consultant at Centric.be, a security consultant, and various species of engineer.


There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)



You can also find me on [Twitter] (https://twitter.com/indig057), though I prefer end-to-end encrypted email for most purposes [contact info] (http://tife.org/scripts/stef.txt).

Thanks for reading!
